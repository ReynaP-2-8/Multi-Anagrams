# Multi-Anagrams

This program takes an input number and it prints each scrabble legal word of that length that can be rearranged to be legal words that start with each letter. 
For example "[opts, pots, stop, tops]" would be printed.

twl.py is used for a scrabble dictionary and is borrowed from https://github.com/fogleman/TWL06
